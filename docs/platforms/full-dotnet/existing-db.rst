Console Application to Existing Database (Database First)
=========================================================

In this walkthrough, you will build a console application that performs basic data access against a Microsoft SQL Server database using Entity Framework. You will use reverse engineering to create an Entity Framework model based on an existing database.

Prerequisites
-------------

The following prerequisites are needed to complete this walkthrough:

* Visual Studio 2015 Update 2
* `Latest version of NuGet Package Manager <https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/5d345edc-2e2d-4a9c-b73b-d53956dc458d>`_
* `Latest version of Windows PowerShell <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40855>`_
* `Blogging database`_

Blogging database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This tutorial uses a **Blogging** database on your LocalDb instance as the existing database.

.. include:: /platforms/_shared/create-blogging-database-vs.txt

Create a new project
--------------------

* Open Visual Studio 2015
* :menuselection:`File --> New --> Project...`
* From the left menu select :menuselection:`Templates --> Visual C# --> Windows`
* Select the **Console Application** project template
* Ensure you are targeting **.NET Framework 4.5.1** or later
* Give the project a name and click **OK**

Install Entity Framework
------------------------

To use EF Core, install the package for the database provider(s) you want to target. This walkthrough uses SQL Server. For a list of available providers see :doc:`/providers/index`.

* :menuselection:`Tools --> NuGet Package Manager --> Package Manager Console`
* Run ``Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer –Pre``

To enable reverse engineering from an existing database we need to install a couple of other packages too.

* Run ``Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools –Pre``
* Run ``Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer.Design –Pre``

Reverse engineer your model
---------------------------

Now it's time to create the EF model based on your existing database.

* :menuselection:`Tools –> NuGet Package Manager –> Package Manager Console`
* Run the following command to create a model from the existing database

.. literalinclude:: _static/reverse-engineer-command.txt

The reverse engineer process created entity classes and a derived context based on the schema of the existing database. The entity classes are simple C# objects that represent the data you will be querying and saving.

.. literalinclude:: /samples/FullNetFramework/EFGetStarted.ConsoleApp.ExistingDb/Blog.cs
        :language: c#
        :linenos:

The context represents a session with the database and allows you to query and save instances of the entity classes.

.. literalinclude:: /samples/FullNetFramework/EFGetStarted.ConsoleApp.ExistingDb/BloggingContext.cs
        :language: c#
        :linenos:

Use your model
--------------

You can now use your model to perform data access.

* Open *Program.cs*
* Replace the contents of the file with the following code

.. literalinclude:: /samples/FullNetFramework/EFGetStarted.ConsoleApp.ExistingDb/Program.cs
        :language: c#
        :linenos:

* :menuselection:`Debug --> Start Without Debugging`

You will see that one blog is saved to the database and then the details of all blogs are printed to the console.
