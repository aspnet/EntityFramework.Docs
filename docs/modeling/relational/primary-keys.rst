Primary Keys
============

A primary key constraint is introduced for the key of each entity type.

Conventions
-----------

By convention, the primary key in the database will be named ``PK_<type name>``.

Data Annotations
----------------

No relational database specific aspects of a primary key can be configured using Data Annotations.

Fluent API
----------

You can use the Fluent API to configure the name of the primary key constraint in the database.
