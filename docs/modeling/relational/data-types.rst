Data Types
==========

Data type refers to the database specific type of the column to which a property is mapped.

Conventions
-----------

By convention, the database provider selects a data type based on the CLR type of the property. It also takes into account other metadata, such as the configured :doc:`/modeling/max-length`, whether the property is part of a primary key, etc.

For example, SQL Server uses ``datetime2(7)`` for ``DateTime`` properties, and ``nvarchar(max)`` for ``string`` properties (or ``nvarchar(450)`` for ``string`` properties that are used as a key).

Data Annotations
----------------

You can use Data Annotations to specify an exact data type for the column.

Fluent API
----------

You can use the Fluent API to specify an exact data type for the column.

        :lines: 5-21
        :emphasize-lines: 7-9

If you are targeting more than one relational provider with the same model then you probably want to specify a data type for each provider rather than a global one to be used for all relational providers.
