Foreign Key Constraints
=======================

A foreign key constraint is introduced for each relationship in the model.

Conventions
-----------

By convention, foreign key constraints are named ``FK_<dependent type name>_<principal type name>_<foreign key property name>``. For composite foreign keys ``<foreign key property name>`` becomes an underscore separated list of foreign key property names.

Data Annotations
----------------

Foreign key constraint names cannot be configured using data annotations.

Fluent API
----------

You can use the Fluent API to configure the foreign key constraint name for a relationship.
