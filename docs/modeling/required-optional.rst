Required/optional properties
============================

A property is considered optional if it is valid for it to contain ``null``. If ``null`` is not a valid value to be assigned to a property then it is considered to be a required property.

Conventions
-----------

By convention, a property whose CLR type can contain null will be configured as optional (``string``, ``int?``, ``byte[]``, etc.). Properties whose CLR type cannot contain null will be configured as required (``int``, ``decimal``, ``bool``, etc.).

.. note::
    A property whose CLR type cannot contain null cannot be configured as optional. The property will always be considered required by Entity Framework.

Data Annotations

You can use Data Annotations to indicate that a property is required.
