Error: "No parameterless constructor was found"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Design-time tools attempt to automatically find how your application creates instances of your DbContext type. If EF cannot find a suitable way to initialize your DbContext, you may encounter this error.

.. code-block:: text

    No parameterless constructor was found on 'TContext'. Either add a parameterless constructor to
    'TContext' or add an implementation of 'IDbContextFactory<TContext>' in the same assembly as
    'TContext'.

As the error message suggests, one solution is to add an implementation of ``IDbContextFactory<TContext>`` to the current project. See :ref:`use_idbcontextfactory` for an example of how to create this factory.
