.NET Core CLI
=============

EF command-line tools for .NET Core Command Line Interface (CLI).

.. note::
    Command-line tools for .NET Core CLI has known issues. See `Preview 1 Known Issues`_ for more details.

Prerequisites
-------------

EF command-line tools requires .NET Core CLI Preview 1 or newer. See `.NET Core's Website <http://dotnet.github.io/>`_ for installation instructions.

Installing
----------

EF command-line tools for .NET Core CLI are installed by manually editing ``project.json``. 

1. Add ``Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools`` as a build-only dependency under "dependencies" and as a "tool". Also add "imports" if you are using "netcoreapp1.0" as a framework. See sample project.json below.
2. Execute ``dotnet restore``. If restore does not succeed, the command-line tools may not have installed correctly.

The resulting project.json should include these items (in addition to your other project dependencies).

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "dependencies": {
            "Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools": {
                "type": "build",
                "version": "1.0.0-preview1"
            }
        },

        "tools": {
            "Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools": {
                "imports": ["portable-net451+win8"],
                "version": "1.0.0-preview1"
            }
        },

        "frameworks": {
            "netcoreapp1.0": {
                "imports": "portable-net451+win8"
            }
        }
    }

.. tip::
    A build-only dependency (``"type": "build"``) means this dependency is local to the current project. For example, if Project A has a build only dependency and Project B depends on A, ``dotnet restore`` will not add A's build-only dependencies into Project B.

Supported Frameworks
--------------------

EF supports .NET Core CLI commands on these frameworks:

 - "net451" and newer
 - "netcoreapp1.0"

Usage
-----
Commands can be run from the command line by navigating to the project directory and executing ``dotnet ef [subcommand]``. To see usage, add ``--help`` to any command to see more information about parameters and subcommands.

.. TODO add usage here

Preview 1 Known Issues
----------------------

"dotnet ef" cannot be used on class library project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.NET Core CLI does not support running commands on class libraries as of Preview 1.

See issue https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/2645. 

Workaround
^^^^^^^^^^
Convert your class library project into an "app" project. This can either be a .NET Core app or a desktop .NET app.

To make the project a .NET Core App, add the "netcoreapp1.0" framework to project.json along with the other settings in the sample below:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "frameworks": {
            "netcoreapp1.0": {
                "imports": ["portable-net451+win8"],
                "buildOptions": {
                    "emitEntryPoint": true
                },
                "dependencies": {
                    "Microsoft.NETCore.App": {
                        "type": "platform",
                        "version": "1.0.0-*"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

To make a desktop .NET app, ensure you project targets "net451" or newer (example "net461" also works) and ensure the build option ``"emitEntryPoint"`` is set to true.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "frameworks": {
            "net451": {
                "buildOptions": {
                    "emitEntryPoint": true
                }
            }
        }
    }


NuGet error: ``One or more packages are incompatible with .NETCoreApp,Version=v1.0.``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When attempting to add Entity Framework Core with in to a .NET Core app, ``dotnet restore`` may issue the following NuGet error:

.. code-block:: plain

    Package Ix-Async 1.2.5 is not compatible with netcoreapp1.0 (.NETCoreApp,Version=v1.0). Package Ix-Async 1.2.5 supports:
      - net40 (.NETFramework,Version=v4.0)
      - net45 (.NETFramework,Version=v4.5)
      - portable-net45+win8+wp8 (.NETPortable,Version=v0.0,Profile=Profile78)
    Package Remotion.Linq 2.0.2 is not compatible with netcoreapp1.0 (.NETCoreApp,Version=v1.0). Package Remotion.Linq 2.0.2 supports:
      - net35 (.NETFramework,Version=v3.5)
      - net40 (.NETFramework,Version=v4.0)
      - net45 (.NETFramework,Version=v4.5)
      - portable-net45+win8+wp8+wpa81 (.NETPortable,Version=v0.0,Profile=Profile259)

This happens because EF Core has two dependencies, "Ix-Async" and "Remotion.Linq", that have not upgraded to support .NET Standard yet.

See issue https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFramework/issues/5176.

Workaround
^^^^^^^^^^
As a tempoarary workaround, projects can manually import other frameworks. To import Ix-Async and Remotion.Linq, add the following to your "imports" section in project.json.

.. code-block:: json
    
    {
        "frameworks": {
            "netcoreapp1.0": {
                "imports": [
                    "portable-net451+win8"
                ]
            }
        }
    }
