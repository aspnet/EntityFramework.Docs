MySQL (Coming Soon)
===================

We are working with the MySQL team to make a MySQL provider available. Please direct any questions about this provider, including the release timeline, to the `MySQL Project <http://forums.mysql.com/list.php?38>`_.

DevArt dotConnect does offer a paid provider for MySQL, see :doc:`/providers/devart/index` for details.

Some Non-Official open source providers

1. `Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql <https://github.com/PomeloFoundation/Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql>`_.
2. `SapientGuardian.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql <https://github.com/SapientGuardian/SapientGuardian.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql>`_.
