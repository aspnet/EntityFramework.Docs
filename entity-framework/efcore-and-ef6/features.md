# EF Core and EF6 Feature by Feature Comparison

The following table compares the features available in EF Core and EF6. It is intended to give a high level comparison and does not list every feature, or attempt to give details on possible differences between how the same feature works.

The EF Core column contains the number of the product version in which the feature first appeared.
