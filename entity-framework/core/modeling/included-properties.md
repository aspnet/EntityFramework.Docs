# Including & Excluding Properties

Including a property in the model means that EF has metadata about that property and will attempt to read and write values from/to the database.

## Conventions

By convention, public properties with a getter and a setter will be included in the model.

## Data Annotations

You can use Data Annotations to exclude a property from the model.

## Fluent API
