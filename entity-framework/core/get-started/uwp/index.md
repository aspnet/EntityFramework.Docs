# Getting Started with EF Core on Universal Windows Platform (UWP)

These 101 tutorials require no previous knowledge of Entity Framework Core or Visual Studio. They will take you step-by-step through creating a simple Universal Window Platform (UWP) application that queries and saves data from a database.

You can find the UWP documentation at [developer.microsoft.com/windows/apps/develop](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/apps/develop).

> [!NOTE]  
> These tutorials and the accompanying samples have been updated to use EF Core 2.0 (with the exception of the UWP tutorial, that still uses EF Core 1.1). However, in the majority of cases it should be possible to create applications that use previous releases, with minimal modification to the instructions.
