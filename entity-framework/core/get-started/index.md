# Getting Started with Entity Framework Core

## [Installing EF Core](install/index.md)

A summary of the steps necessary to add EF Core to your application in different platforms and popular IDEs.

## Step-by-step Tutorials

These introductory tutorials require no previous knowledge of Entity Framework Core or a particular IDE. They will take you step-by-step through creating a simple application that queries and saves data from a database. We have provided tutorials to get you started on various operating systems and application types.

Entity Framework Core can create a model based on an existing database, or create a database for you based on your model. There are tutorials that demonstrate both of these approaches.

> [!NOTE]  
> These tutorials and the accompanying samples have been updated to use EF Core 2.0 (with the exception of the UWP tutorial, that still uses EF Core 1.1). However, in the majority of cases it should be possible to create applications that use previous releases, with minimal modification to the instructions.
