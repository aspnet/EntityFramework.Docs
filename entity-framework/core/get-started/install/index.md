# Installing Entity Framework Core

## Prerequisites

* To develop apps that target .NET Core 2.1, install [the .NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core). The SDK has to be installed even if you have the latest version of Visual Studio 2017.

* To use Visual Studio for development of apps that target .NET Core 2.1, install Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7 or later.

* To use Entity Framework 2.1 in ASP.NET Core applications, use ASP.NET Core 2.1. Applications that use earlier versions of ASP.NET Core must be updated to 2.1.

* You can use Visual Studio 2015 for apps that target the .NET Framework 4.6.1 or later. But you need a version of NuGet that is aware of the .NET Standard 2.0 and its compatible frameworks. To get that in Visual Studio 2015, [upgrade the NuGet client to version 3.6.0](https://www.nuget.org/downloads).

## Get the Entity Framework Core runtime

To add EF Core runtime libraries to an application, install the NuGet package for the database provider you want to use. For a list of supported providers and their NuGet package names, see [Database providers](../../providers/index.md).

To install or update NuGet packages, use the .NET Core CLI, the Visual Studio Package Manager UI, or the Visual Studio Package Manager Console.

> [!TIP]  
> If you need to update an application that is using a third-party database provider, always check for an update of the provider that is compatible with the version of EF Core you want to use. For example, database providers for previous versions are not compatible with version 2.1 of the EF Core runtime.  

### .NET Core CLI

The following .NET Core CLI command installs or updates the SQL Server provider:

``` Console
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
```

You can indicate a specific version in the `dotnet add package` command, using the `-v` modifier. For example, to install EF Core 2.1.0 packages, append `-v 2.1.0` to the command.

### Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager UI

* From the menu, select **Project > Manage NuGet Packages**

* Click on the **Browse** or the **Updates** tab

* To install or upddate the SQL Server provider, select the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer` package, and confirm.

For more information, see [NuGet Package Manager UI](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/tools/package-manager-ui).

### Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager Console (PMC)

* From the menu, select **Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console**

* To install the SQL Server provider, run the following command in the PMC:

  ``` PowerShell  
  Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
  ```
* To update the provider, use the `Update-Package` command.

* To specify a specific version, use the `-Version` modifier. For example, to install EF Core 2.1.0 packages, append `-Version 2.1.0` to the commands

For more information, see [Package Manager Console](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/tools/package-manager-console).

## Get Entity Framework Core tools

Besides the runtime libraries, you can install tools that can perform some EF Core-related tasks in your project at design time. For example, you can create migrations, apply migrations, and create a model based on an existing database.

Two sets of tools are available:
* The .NET Core [command-line interface (CLI) tools](../../miscellaneous/cli/dotnet.md) can be used on Windows, Linux, or macOS. These commands begin with `dotnet ef`. 
* The [Package Manager Console (PMC) tools](../../miscellaneous/cli/powershell.md)  run in Visual Studio 2017 on Windows. These commands start with a verb, for example `Add-Migration`, `Update-Database`.

Although you can use the `dotnet ef` commands from the PMC, it's more convenient to use the PMC tools when you're using Visual Studio:
* They automatically work with the current project selected in the PMC without requiring manually switching directories.  
* They automatically open files generated by the commands in Visual Studio after the command is completed.

### Get the CLI tools

To get the .NET Core CLI tools for EF Core, install the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design` package:

 ``` Console	
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design	
```	

For ASP.NET Core 2.1 apps, this package is included automatically.

As explained earlier in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites), you also need to install the .NET Core 2.1 SDK.

> [!IMPORTANT]  	
> Always use the version of the tools package that matches the major version of the runtime packages.

### Get the PMC tools

To get the .NET Core CLI tools for EF Core, install the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools` package:

 ``` Console	
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
```	

For ASP.NET Core 2.1 apps, this package is included automatically.

## Upgading to EF Core 2.1

If you're upgrading an existing application to EF Core 2.1, some references to older EF Core packages may need to be removed manually:

* Database provider design-time packages such as `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer.Design` are no longer required or supported in EF Core 2.1, but aren't automatically removed when upgrading the other packages.

* The .NET CLI tools are now included in the .NET SDK, so the reference to that package can be removed from the *.csproj* file:

  ```
  <DotNetCliToolReference Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools.DotNet" Version="2.0.0" />
  ```

For applications that target the .NET Framework and were created by earlier versions of Visual Studio, make sure that they are compatible with .NET Standard 2.0 libraries:

  * Edit the project file and make sure the following entry appears in the initial property group:

    ``` xml
    <AutoGenerateBindingRedirects>true</AutoGenerateBindingRedirects>
    ```

  * For test projects, also make sure the following entry is present:

    ``` xml
    <GenerateBindingRedirectsOutputType>true</GenerateBindingRedirectsOutputType>
    ```
