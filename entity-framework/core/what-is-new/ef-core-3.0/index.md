> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that the feature sets and schedules of future releases are always subject to change, and although we will try to keep this page up to date, it may not reflect our latest plans at all times.

EF Core 3.0 is currently under development and available as [preview packages published to the NuGet Gallery](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore/). 

Current previews of EF Core 3.0 only include minor improvements and [breaking changes](xref:core/what-is-new/ef-core-3.0/breaking-changes) we have made in preparation for the rest of the 3.0 work. 

Successive preview releases will contain more of [the planned features](xref:core/what-is-new/ef-core-3.0/features).
