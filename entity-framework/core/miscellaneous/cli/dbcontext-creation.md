Design-time DbContext Creation
==============================
Some of the EF Tools commands require a DbContext instance to be created at design time (for example, when running
Migrations commands). There are various ways the tools try to create it.

From application services
-------------------------
If your startup project is an ASP.NET Core app, the tools try to obtain the DbContext object from the application's
service provider. They obtain it by invoking `Program.BuildWebHost()` and accessing the `IWebHost.Services` property. Any
DbContext registered using `IServiceCollection.AddDbContext<TContext>()` can be found and created this way. This pattern
was [introduced in ASP.NET Core 2.0][1]

Using the default constructor
-----------------------------
If the DbContext can't be obtained from the application service provider, the tools look for the DbContext type inside
the project. They try to create it using its default constructor.

From a design-time factory
--------------------------
You can also tell the tools how to create your DbContext by implementing `IDesignTimeDbContextFactory`. If a class
implementing this interface is found inside your project, the tools bypass the other ways of creating the DbContext.
They always use the factory at design time. A factory is especially useful if you need to configure the DbContext
differently for design time than at runtime.

``` csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Infrastructure;

namespace MyProject
{
    public class BloggingContextFactory : IDesignTimeDbContextFactory<BloggingContext>
    {
        public BloggingContext CreateDbContext(string[] args)
        {
            var optionsBuilder = new DbContextOptionsBuilder<BloggingContext>();
            optionsBuilder.UseSqlite("Data Source=blog.db");

            return new BloggingContext(optionsBuilder.Options);
        }
    }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `args` parameter is currently unused. There is [an issue][2] tracking the ability to specify design-time arguments
