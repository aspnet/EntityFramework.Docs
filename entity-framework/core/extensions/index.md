# EF Core Tools & Extensions

Tools and extensions provide additional functionality for Entity Framework Core.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Extensions are built by a variety of sources and not maintained as part of the Entity Framework Core project. When considering a third party extension, be sure to evaluate quality, licensing, compatibility, support, etc. to ensure they meet your requirements.

## Tools

### CatFactory

CatFactory is a scaffolding engine for .NET Core and Entity Framework Core. The concept behind CatFactory it's export an existing database from SQL Server instance, then with the representation in models for database; scaffold entities, configurations, repositories and more.

[GitHub repository](https://github.com/hherzl/CatFactory.EntityFrameworkCore)

### LLBLGen Pro

LLBLGen Pro is an entity modeling solution with support for Entity Framework and Entity Framework Core. It lets you easily define your entity model and map it to your database, using database first or model first, so you can get started writing queries right away.

### Devart Entity Developer

Entity Developer is a powerful ORM designer for ADO.NET Entity Framework, NHibernate, LinqConnect, Telerik Data Access, and LINQ to SQL. You can use  Model-First and Database-First approaches to design your ORM model and generate C# or Visual Basic .NET code for it. It introduces new approaches for designing ORM models, boosts productivity, and facilitates the development of database applications.

### EF Core Power Tools

Visual Studio 2017+ extension. You can reverse engineer of DbContext and POCO classes from an existing database or SQL Server Database project, and visualize and inspect your DbContext in various ways.

### Entity Framework Visual Editor

A Visual Studio 2017 extension that adds an ORM designer for visual design of Entity Framework 6, Core 2.0 and Core 2.1 classes. Code is generated using T4 templates so can be completely customized to suit any needs. Inheritance, unidirectional and bidirectional associations are all supported, as are enumerations and the ability to color-code your classes and add text blocks to explain potentially arcane parts of your design.

### Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.AutoHistory

A plugin for Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore to support automatically recording data changes history.

### EFSecondLevelCache.Core

Second Level Caching Library. Second level caching is a query cache. The results of EF commands will be stored in the cache, so that the same EF commands will retrieve their data from the cache rather than executing them against the database again.

[GitHub repository](https://github.com/VahidN/EFSecondLevelCache.Core/)

### Detached.EntityFramework
