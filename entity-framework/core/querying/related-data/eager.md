# Eager Loading of Related Data

## Eager loading

You can use the `Include` method to specify related data to be included in query results. In the following example, the blogs that are returned in the results will have their `Posts` property populated with the related posts.

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../../samples/core/Querying/RelatedData/Program.cs#SingleInclude)]

> [!TIP]
> Entity Framework Core will automatically fix-up navigation properties to any other entities that were previously loaded into the context instance. So even if you don't explicitly include the data for a navigation property, the property may still be populated if some or all of the related entities were previously loaded.

You can include related data from multiple relationships in a single query.

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../../samples/core/Querying/RelatedData/Program.cs#MultipleIncludes)]

## Including multiple levels

You can drill down through relationships to include multiple levels of related data using the `ThenInclude` method. The following example loads all blogs, their related posts, and the author of each post.

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../../samples/core/Querying/RelatedData/Program.cs#SingleThenInclude)]

You can chain multiple calls to `ThenInclude` to continue including further levels of related data.

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../../samples/core/Querying/RelatedData/Program.cs#MultipleThenIncludes)]

You can combine all of the calls to include related data from multiple levels and multiple roots in the same query.

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../../samples/core/Querying/RelatedData/Program.cs#IncludeTree)]

You may want to include multiple related entities for one of the entities that is being included. For example, when querying `Blogs`, you include `Posts` and then want to include both the `Author` and `Tags` of the `Posts`. To include both, you need to specify each include path starting at the root. For example, `Blog -> Posts -> Author` and `Blog -> Posts -> Tags`. It doesn't mean you'll get redundant joins; in most cases, EF will combine the joins when generating SQL.

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../../samples/core/Querying/RelatedData/Program.cs#MultipleLeafIncludes)]

## Single and split queries

### Single queries

In relational databases, all related entities are by default loaded by introducing JOINs:

```sql
SELECT [b].[BlogId], [b].[OwnerId], [b].[Rating], [b].[Url], [p].[PostId], [p].[AuthorId], [p].[BlogId], [p].[Content], [p].[Rating], [p].[Title]
FROM [Blogs] AS [b]
LEFT JOIN [Post] AS [p] ON [b].[BlogId] = [p].[BlogId]
ORDER BY [b].[BlogId], [p].[PostId]
```

If a typical blog has multiple related posts, rows for these posts will duplicate the blog's information, leading to the so-called "cartesian explosion" problem. As more one-to-many relationships are loaded, the amount of duplicated data may grow and adversely affect the performance of your application. By default, EF Core emits a warning if it detects queries loading collection includes that may cause performance issues.

### Split queries

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is introduced in EF Core 5.0.

EF allows you to specify that a given LINQ query should be *split* into multiple SQL queries. Instead of JOINs, split queries perform an additional SQL query for each included one-to-many navigation:

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../../samples/core/Querying/RelatedData/Program.cs?name=AsSplitQuery&highlight=5)]

It will produce the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT [b].[BlogId], [b].[OwnerId], [b].[Rating], [b].[Url]
FROM [Blogs] AS [b]
ORDER BY [b].[BlogId]

SELECT [p].[PostId], [p].[AuthorId], [p].[BlogId], [p].[Content], [p].[Rating], [p].[Title], [b].[BlogId]
FROM [Blogs] AS [b]
INNER JOIN [Post] AS [p] ON [b].[BlogId] = [p].[BlogId]
ORDER BY [b].[BlogId]
```

> [!NOTE]
> One-to-one related entities are always loaded via JOINs in the same query, as this has no performance impact.

### Enabling split queries globally

You can also configure split queries as the default for your application's context:

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../../samples/core/Querying/RelatedData/SplitQueriesBloggingContext.cs?name=QuerySplittingBehaviorSplitQuery&highlight=6)]

When split queries are configured as the default, it is still possible to configure specific queries to execute as single queries:

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../../samples/core/Querying/RelatedData/Program.cs?name=AsSingleQuery&highlight=5)]

If the query splitting mode isn't explicitly specified - neither globally nor on the query - and EF Core detects that a single query loads multiple collection includes, a warning is emitted to draw attention to the potential resulting performance issues. Setting the query mode to SingleQuery will cause the warning not to be generated.

### Characteristics of split queries

While split query avoids the performance issues associated with JOINs and cartesian explosion, it also has some drawbacks:

* While most databases guarantee data consistency for single queries, no such guarantees exist for multiple queries. If the database is updated concurrently when executing your queries, resulting data may not be consistent. You can mitigate it by wrapping the queries in a serializable or snapshot transaction, although doing so may create performance issues of its own. For more information, see your database's documentation.
* Each query currently implies an additional network roundtrip to your database. Multiple network roundtrip can degrade performance, especially where latency to the database is high (for example, cloud services).
* While some databases allow consuming the results of multiple queries at the same time (SQL Server with MARS, Sqlite), most allow only a single query to be active at any given point. So all results from earlier queries must be buffered in your application's memory before executing later queries, which leads to increased memory requirements.

Unfortunately, there isn't one strategy for loading related entities that fits all scenarios. Carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages of single and split queries, and select the one that fits your needs.

## Filtered include

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is introduced in EF Core 5.0.

When applying Include to load related data, you can apply certain enumerable operations on the included collection navigation, which allows for filtering and sorting of the results.

Supported operations are: `Where`, `OrderBy`, `OrderByDescending`, `ThenBy`, `ThenByDescending`, `Skip`, and `Take`.

Such operations should be applied on the collection navigation in the lambda passed to the Include method, as shown in example below:

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../../samples/core/Querying/RelatedData/Program.cs#FilteredInclude)]

Each included navigation allows only one unique set of filter operations. In cases where multiple Include operations are applied for a given collection navigation (`blog.Posts` in the examples below), filter operations can only be specified on one of them:

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../../samples/core/Querying/RelatedData/Program.cs#MultipleLeafIncludesFiltered1)]

Instead, identical operations can be applied for each navigation that is included multiple times:

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../../samples/core/Querying/RelatedData/Program.cs#MultipleLeafIncludesFiltered2)]

> [!CAUTION]
> In case of tracking queries, results of Filtered Include may be unexpected due to [navigation fixup](xref:core/querying/tracking). All relevant entities that have been queried for previously and have been stored in the Change Tracker will be present in the results of Filtered Include query, even if they don't meet the requirements of the filter. Consider using `NoTracking` queries or re-create the DbContext when using Filtered Include in those situations.

Example:

```csharp
var orders = context.Orders.Where(o => o.Id > 1000).ToList();

// customer entities will have references to all orders where Id > 1000, rather than > 5000
var filtered = context.Customers.Include(c => c.Orders.Where(o => o.Id > 5000)).ToList();
```

## Include on derived types

You can include related data from navigation defined only on a derived type using `Include` and `ThenInclude`.

Given the following model:

```csharp
public class SchoolContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<Person> People { get; set; }
    public DbSet<School> Schools { get; set; }

    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        modelBuilder.Entity<School>().HasMany(s => s.Students).WithOne(s => s.School);
    }
}

public class Person
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

public class Student : Person
{
    public School School { get; set; }
}

public class School
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public List<Student> Students { get; set; }
}
```

Contents of `School` navigation of all People who are Students can be eagerly loaded using a number of patterns:

* using cast

  ```csharp
  context.People.Include(person => ((Student)person).School).ToList()
  ```

* using `as` operator

  ```csharp
  context.People.Include(person => (person as Student).School).ToList()
  ```

* using overload of `Include` that takes parameter of type `string`

  ```csharp
  context.People.Include("School").ToList()
  ```
